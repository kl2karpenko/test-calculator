# testKnockout

Create:
1) Online calculator with only 4 operations: add, substract, multiply and divide, and 10 digits
2) Create a history under your calculator that will save the results of all calculations ( mean that you save it localy, dont use any server) 

For this task you should use HTML, CSS and JS. For UI you can use what ever you want, e.g. Boostrap, as a main JS framework please use KnockoutJS http://knockoutjs.com/

The main idea: do not use addEventListeners to elements, use observables from KnockoutJS framework and the framework main logic, please do not use jQuery.
